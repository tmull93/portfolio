## About Me

I am an interdisciplinary psychologist focused on modeling, predicting, and enhancing human-computer interaction within complex team environments. Under the mentorship of Dr. Mary Jean Amon and Dr. Stephen Fiore, my research draws on nonlinear dynamical systems theory—particularly recurrence-based methods—to investigate how coordination unfolds over time to shape individual and collective outcomes, including perceptions, mental states, and performance.

This page provides an overview of my recent work. Use the links at the top to explore my projects, publications, and philosophies in greater detail.

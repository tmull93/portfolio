What if your car could sense when you’re frustrated—and help you calm down before things go sideways? That’s the kind of question driving our latest project (pun intended). We’re teaming up to explore how emotional transitions affect drivers, especially when control shifts between humans and autonomous systems. 
 
In collaboration with Ancuta Margondai, Sara Willox, and Mustapha Mouloua, I’m contributing to the development of a framework that combines discrete event simulation (DES) and physiological monitoring to better understand how drivers recover emotionally during control transitions. Research suggests that AI-assisted, multi-modal approaches can not only improve recovery time by up to 40%, but also achieve 90% accuracy in identifying moments of high emotional arousal.

By identifying key markers—like changes in heart rate or sudden behavioral shifts—we hope to proactively manage emotional states that often contribute to aggressive driving, a factor in nearly 30% of crashes. This work not only advances theoretical understanding but also opens the door to practical interventions that could make autonomous systems safer and more responsive.

This work is on-going but more information should be available soon!


**UPDATE!** A "work in progress" version of this project will be presented at [ANNSIM 2025](https://annsim.org/)!

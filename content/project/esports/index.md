The most popular competitive games are team-based, where winning depends on combining individual skill with collective decision-making. While esports has grown into a global phenomenon with major prize pools and huge audiences, we still don't fully understand the science behind successful teamwork in this space. What makes a successful esports team? Why doesn't a team of experts make an expert team? 

To tackle this question, I'm applying established team science frameworks to examine how coordination works in esports. This approach helps connect team composition and structure to processes like communication and shared understanding, and ultimately to performance outcomes. I'm specifically interested in how teams function as units. By studying how teams communicate, synchronize, and adapt during matches, I hope to identify patterns that distinguish successful teams.

For this project, I plan to collect multiple streams of real-time data, including physiological measures, game logs, behavioral observations, and team communications, to monitor coordination as it happens. I'm partnering with faculty at UCF to leverage the power of **digital twins** to develop systems that can process these diverse data streams simultaneously and detect anomalies that might signal coordination breakdowns or teamwork issues. This multi-method approach should give us unprecedented insight into the moment-by-moment dynamics of team performance.

The goal is to bridge theory and practice, potentially developing ways to recognize coordination patterns and improve coaching approaches. This work could help us understand what separates championship teams from the rest, with implications that might extend beyond esports to other fields where teamwork matters.

This project is just getting started so check back in or reach out for updates!

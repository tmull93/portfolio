Humans are remarkably good at building mental models of the world around themâ€”including the goals, intentions, and perspectives of others. This ability, known as theory of mind, plays a critical role in how we collaborate and coordinate effectively in teams. High-performing teams often share key aspects of these models, creating a shared understanding of their environment, tools, and strategies. These forms of social intelligence are fundamental to human teamwork.

The DARPA Artificial Social Intelligence for Successful Teams (ASIST) program was designed to extend this kind of reasoning to artificial intelligence. The goal was to develop AI agents capable of interpreting human goals, predicting needs, and acting as adaptive, resilient teammates in complex environments. To support this effort, Arizona State University conducted a study using a Minecraft-based urban search and rescue task, where three-person teams worked together in a dynamic, open-world setting, some with an AI advisor and some without. The resulting ASIST dataset includes data from approximately 1,160 teams, with rich behavioral, contextual, and interactional data. 

I've partered with Rhyse Bendell, Jessica Williams, and Stephen Fiore to investigate if, when, and how the AI-advisor impacted teamwork throughout the simualted mission using analyses from nonlinear dynamical systems theory. 

We are actively working on this project and hope to share more soon!

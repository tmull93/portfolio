While previous research typically treats team communication and trust in automation as separate factors that each positively impact performance, we wanted to understand how these crucial factors interact in complex operational environments.

Working with the U.S. Army's [DEVCOM Research Laboratory](https://arl.devcom.army.mil/), we tracked how soldiers communicated during simulated combat missions while operating alongside autonomous systems. The unique longitudinal design allowed us to follow the same team through multiple missions, capturing how their communication patterns evolved in relation to their trust towards the autonomous systems they used.

The results revealed something fascinating and counterintuitive. Team members who reported lower trust in automation spoke significantly more than those with higher trust. This effect remained even when controlling for factors like team trust, workload, role, and mission performance. This pattern challenges conventional wisdom that both increased communication and higher trust in automation independently lead to better team outcomes. While this reduced communication might reflect efficiency, it could also indicate subtle changes in team dynamics that deserve closer attention. 

This research opens new questions about how trust shapes team processes and how we should design and evaluate autonomous systems that truly enhance rather than disrupt effective team dynamics.

In our latest research project, [Andres KÃ¤osaar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andres-k%C3%A4osaar-322760b5/) and I examined how we can use physiological data to understand team coordination in extreme environments. We looked at how coordinated responses to challenges impacted stress and daily emotions for crew-members on a space analog mission, using team members' heart rates synchronization as a proxy for coordination.

We partenred with the [LunAres Research Station](https://lunares.space/) where crews participate in two-week long space analog missions, complete with simulated EVAs (extravehicular activities) that demand precise coordination in pressurized suits. By capturing continuous heart rate data from team members during these high-stakes activities, we gained access to a fascinating window into their shared physiological responses.

It may come as no surprise that we grounded our analysis in nonlinear dynamical systems theory. Rather than simply averaging heart rates or looking at isolated spikes, we applied **Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis** (cRQA) to identify moments when team members' heart rate patterns aligned. These recurrence patterns reveal coordination that might not be visible through traditional measures. By examining metrics like recurrence rate alongside subjective reports of stress and emotion, we're piecing together a more complete picture of team dynamics in extreme conditions.

One of the most intriguing aspects of this work is what it might mean for real space missions. As we prepare for extended missions to the Moon and Mars, understanding how crews maintain coordination under pressure becomes increasingly vital. Physiological synchrony might offer an objective, real-time measure that could help mission control identify when interventions are needed.

We're still analyzing the full dataset, but the preliminary findings suggest that heart rate synchronization relates to both stress and emotional experiences during EVAs. 

**UPDATE!** A sneak peek into this project is in pre-print and will be presented at [INGRoup 2025](https://www.ingroup.net/)!

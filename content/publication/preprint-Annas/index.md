abstract: This work-in-progress introduces a framework for analyzing emotional transitions in autonomous drivers. It combines discrete event simulation (DES) with physiological monitoring to model emotional recovery during control transitions. Literature shows that AI-driven interventions using multi-modal analysis can enhance emotional recovery and vehicle control, potentially cutting recovery time by 40% and achieving 90% accuracy in identifying high emotional arousal. The framework aims to address 30% of crashes linked to aggressive driving through proactive emotional state management. Key indicators for aggressive driving include physiological markers (e.g., elevated heart rate), behavioral signs (e.g., sudden acceleration), and emotional classifications that can prompt interventions. The study also explores theoretical and practical implications and suggests future research avenues.

        My work integrates topics such as trust in human-computer interactions, macrocognitive processes in teams, communication dynamics, and physiological sensing. By bridging behavioral, cognitive, and physiological data, I aim to uncover the temporal and systemic underpinnings of effective coordination, ultimately informing the design of technologies and interventions that support adaptive and resilient teamwork.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Humans are remarkably good at building mental models of the world around them—including the goals, intentions, and perspectives of others. This ability, known as theory of mind, plays a critical role in how we collaborate and coordinate effectively in teams. High-performing teams often share key aspects of these models, creating a shared understanding of their environment, tools, and strategies. These forms of social intelligence are fundamental to human teamwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DARPA Artificial Social Intelligence for Successful Teams (ASIST) program was designed to extend this kind of reasoning to artificial intelligence. The goal was to develop AI agents capable of interpreting human goals, predicting needs, and acting as adaptive, resilient teammates in complex environments. To support this effort, Arizona State University conducted a study using a Minecraft-based urban search and rescue task, where three-person teams worked together in a dynamic, open-world setting, some with an AI advisor and some without. The resulting ASIST dataset includes data from approximately 1,160 teams, with rich behavioral, contextual, and interactional data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve partered with Rhyse Bendell, Jessica Williams, and Stephen Fiore to investigate if, when, and how the AI-advisor impacted teamwork throughout the simualted mission using analyses from nonlinear dynamical systems theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are actively working on this project and hope to share more soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Coordination in Esports</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/project/esports/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/project/esports/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most popular competitive games are team-based, where winning depends on combining individual skill with collective decision-making. While esports has grown into a global phenomenon with major prize pools and huge audiences, we still don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand the science behind successful teamwork in this space. What makes a successful esports team? Why doesn&amp;rsquo;t a team of experts make an expert team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tackle this question, I&amp;rsquo;m applying established team science frameworks to examine how coordination works in esports. This approach helps connect team composition and structure to processes like communication and shared understanding, and ultimately to performance outcomes. I&amp;rsquo;m specifically interested in how teams function as units. By studying how teams communicate, synchronize, and adapt during matches, I hope to identify patterns that distinguish successful teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this project, I plan to collect multiple streams of real-time data, including physiological measures, game logs, behavioral observations, and team communications, to monitor coordination as it happens. I&amp;rsquo;m partnering with faculty at UCF to leverage the power of &lt;strong&gt;digital twins&lt;/strong&gt; to develop systems that can process these diverse data streams simultaneously and detect anomalies that might signal coordination breakdowns or teamwork issues. This multi-method approach should give us unprecedented insight into the moment-by-moment dynamics of team performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to bridge theory and practice, potentially developing ways to recognize coordination patterns and improve coaching approaches. This work could help us understand what separates championship teams from the rest, with implications that might extend beyond esports to other fields where teamwork matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is just getting started so check back in or reach out for updates!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emotions, Driving, and AI</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/project/driving_emotions/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What if your car could sense when you’re frustrated—and help you calm down before things go sideways? That’s the kind of question driving our latest project (pun intended). We’re teaming up to explore how emotional transitions affect drivers, especially when control shifts between humans and autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with Ancuta Margondai, Sara Willox, and Mustapha Mouloua, I’m contributing to the development of a framework that combines discrete event simulation (DES) and physiological monitoring to better understand how drivers recover emotionally during control transitions. Research suggests that AI-assisted, multi-modal approaches can not only improve recovery time by up to 40%, but also achieve 90% accuracy in identifying moments of high emotional arousal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By identifying key markers—like changes in heart rate or sudden behavioral shifts—we hope to proactively manage emotional states that often contribute to aggressive driving, a factor in nearly 30% of crashes. This work not only advances theoretical understanding but also opens the door to practical interventions that could make autonomous systems safer and more responsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work is on-going but more information should be available soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE!&lt;/strong&gt; A &amp;ldquo;work in progress&amp;rdquo; version of this project will be presented at &lt;a href=&#34;https://annsim.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ANNSIM 2025&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>jRQA</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/project/jrqa/</link>

    Simulated recurrence plots illustrating how coordination patterns between two participants evolved over time. Colored areas indicate recurring shared states (e.g., one participant&#39;s HR high while the other&#39;s low), while empty spaces reflect novel states. The color key represents different coordination patterns. Visually, the team on the left shows predominately purple and green patterns, whereas the team on the right exhibits more orange and purple, highlighting differences in their coordination dynamics.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-indent: 2em;&#34;&gt; My research explores how teams function as complex adaptive systems. This just means they’re made up of many interconnected parts that interact and evolve over time. One of the biggest challenges in this work is figuring out how to represent a team. Some researchers focus on individual members and how their behaviors influence the group, while others model the team as a single unit to study how it functions as a whole. Each approach has its strengths and trade-offs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of choosing the right modeling technique, my team is especially interested in working with large, complex datasets. For example, in one project, we collected heart rate, posture, activity, and log file data at 32 samples per second over one hour from 14 participants. That’s &lt;strong&gt;8,064,000 data points&lt;/strong&gt; per session! And because we ran this twice a day for ten days, we ended up with over &lt;strong&gt;161 million data points&lt;/strong&gt; in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with this kind of data is no small task. It comes from many people, sensors, and systems—and it&amp;rsquo;s often messy or incomplete. Traditional methods usually require lots of cleaning and reshaping before you can even start analyzing. To tackle this, I partnered with &lt;a href=&#34;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IybuqwUAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Aaron Necaise&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://luddy.indiana.edu/contact/profile/index.html?Mary~Jean_Amon&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dr. Mary Jean Amon&lt;/a&gt; to develop a more flexible approach to &lt;strong&gt;joint recurrence quantification analysis&lt;/strong&gt;, or jRQA, that handles imperfect data with fewer assumptions. jRQA is a technique for detecting shared patterns across time in multiple time series, revealing how systems evolve in relation to each other. You can see an example of a recurrence plot from traditional RQA in the image above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our new method starts by modeling each team member their own nonlinear system. We analyze each team member on their own and then look at how their behavior relates to others over time—drawing on both individual and team-level modeling strategies. This makes it easier to uncover complex team dynamics, even when people are playing different roles or interacting in very different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is still in progress, but we’re excited to share more soon—we’re aiming to submit the full paper in 2025!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LUNAres</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/project/lunares/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/project/lunares/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In our latest research project, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/andres-k%C3%A4osaar-322760b5/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Andres Käosaar&lt;/a&gt; and I examined how we can use physiological data to understand team coordination in extreme environments. We looked at how coordinated responses to challenges impacted stress and daily emotions for crew-members on a space analog mission, using team members&amp;rsquo; heart rates synchronization as a proxy for coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We partenred with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://lunares.space/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LunAres Research Station&lt;/a&gt; where crews participate in two-week long space analog missions, complete with simulated EVAs (extravehicular activities) that demand precise coordination in pressurized suits. By capturing continuous heart rate data from team members during these high-stakes activities, we gained access to a fascinating window into their shared physiological responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may come as no surprise that we grounded our analysis in nonlinear dynamical systems theory. Rather than simply averaging heart rates or looking at isolated spikes, we applied &lt;strong&gt;Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis&lt;/strong&gt; (cRQA) to identify moments when team members&amp;rsquo; heart rate patterns aligned. These recurrence patterns reveal coordination that might not be visible through traditional measures. By examining metrics like recurrence rate alongside subjective reports of stress and emotion, we&amp;rsquo;re piecing together a more complete picture of team dynamics in extreme conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most intriguing aspects of this work is what it might mean for real space missions. As we prepare for extended missions to the Moon and Mars, understanding how crews maintain coordination under pressure becomes increasingly vital. Physiological synchrony might offer an objective, real-time measure that could help mission control identify when interventions are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re still analyzing the full dataset, but the preliminary findings suggest that heart rate synchronization relates to both stress and emotional experiences during EVAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE!&lt;/strong&gt; A sneak peek into this project is in pre-print and will be presented at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ingroup.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;INGRoup 2025&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Macrocognition AI</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/project/mitm_ai/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The macrocognition in teams model developed by Dr. Stephen Fiore provides a framework for understanding how teams build and share knowledge. This model identifies the cognitive processes involved in connecting individual knowledge building to team knowledge building through various explicit and implicit mechanisms. It has been applied in multiple contexts including military operations, healthcare teams, and emergency response settings, offering researchers a structured way to analyze team cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, Dr. Fiore and I are setting out to make this analytical approach more accessible through artificial intelligence. By developing an AI-assisted coding system for team transcripts, we aim to substantially reduce the time and resources needed to apply this framework. This would make using the model more practical, hopefully expanding what we can accomplish in terms of understanding and improving team dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this project is just getting underway, more specific details about methodology and preliminary results will be forthcoming.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/project/sampen/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For this project, I partnered with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/andres-k%C3%A4osaar-322760b5/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Andres Käosaar&lt;/a&gt; to explore how astronaut teams function under extreme conditions, specifically focusing on the emotional patterns that emerge during space missions and simulated space environments. This work addresses a critical challenge for future Mars missions, where NASA will rely on teams operating in isolated, confined, and extreme (ICE) conditions for extended periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While emotions clearly impact team performance, decision-making, creativity, and overall effectiveness, the tools we&amp;rsquo;ve been using to study them (particularly in ICE environments) have significant limitations. Traditional approaches to monitoring teamwork issues often miss the dynamic nature of emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s where nonlinear dyanamical systems theory comes in. We&amp;rsquo;ve applied Sample Entropy (SampEn), a technique that quantifies how predictable emotional patterns are over time. Unlike conventional methods that reduce complex emotional data to simple averages, SampEn preserves the natural fluctuations and temporal complexity of how feelings evolve within teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our dataset was particularly robust. We analyzed emotional expression data from journal entries and communication recordings across four different space analog environments. This diversity allowed us to draw more generalizable conclusions about how emotions functioned in these extreme settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study explores a fascinating tension: on one hand, more complex emotional patterns might indicate healthier team functioning, as adaptive systems typically show natural variability rather than rigid patterns. On the other hand, &amp;ldquo;psychological hibernation&amp;rdquo; (a flattening of emotional expression) might actually be beneficial in ICE environments specifically, serving as a coping mechanism for prolonged isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research represents the first application of SampEn to analyze emotional states in ICE teams, offering a more ecologically valid picture of how team members&amp;rsquo; feelings unfold and impact their collective functioning. By capturing these nonlinear dynamics, we&amp;rsquo;re revealing patterns that traditional analyses would likely miss which, we hope, will be used to support astronaut teams on future missions to the Moon and Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is still in progress, but we’re excited to share more soon—we’re aiming to submit the full paper in 2025!&lt;/p&gt;
